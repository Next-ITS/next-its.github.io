# Usage on HPC cluster

NextITS leverages the capabilities of the Nextflow workflow manager, 
designed to maximize the efficiency and flexibility of your analyses by fully utilizing available computational resources. 
This means that you can seamlessly deploy the pipeline on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, 
making it especially beneficial for large-scale datasets.  

Nextflow is compatible with all major job schedulers, including Slurm, OpenPBS, TORQUE, and Apache Ignite, to name a few. 
In the upcoming section, we'll guide you through the process of setting up and initiating NextITS on a cluster environment, 
like your University's computing cluster.
