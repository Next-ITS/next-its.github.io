## Quick start  

Get started quickly with NextITS by following these simple instructions.  

The pipeline is divided into two main steps:  
1. The first step is executed separately for each sequencing run because it involves the removal of tag-jumps. This step primarily focuses on sequence quality control, ITS extraction, and chimera removal.  
2. The second step combines data from various runs, clusters sequences using either vsearch or swarm, and then performs post-clustering curation.
